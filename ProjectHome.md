This will be a site to bring runners together. It will allow them to:

  * Import their Nike+ run data
  * Map their runs, either manually or by uploading a file from a GPS-enabled device
  * Comment on other people's run routes
  * Track their progress with visualisations

And hopefully a whole lot more!
